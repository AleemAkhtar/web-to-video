# Web-to-Video Recorder

A Node.js application that captures web page animations and converts them into video files. This tool uses Puppeteer to control a headless browser and provides multiple recording methods to create high-quality videos from dynamic web content.

## üéØ What This Project Is About

Web-to-Video Recorder is designed to capture animated web pages and convert them into video format. It's particularly useful for:
- Recording web-based animations and interactions
- Creating demos of web applications
- Capturing chat interfaces or streaming content
- Converting dynamic web content into shareable video files

The project monitors a local web application (running on `http://127.0.0.1:3000`) and waits for an animation to complete (detected via `window.animationFinished` flag) before stopping the recording.

## ‚ú® Features

### üñºÔ∏è Frame-by-Frame Capture (`capture_images.js`)
- **Smart Animation Detection**: Automatically detects when animations are complete using the `window.animationFinished` global variable
- **High-Quality Screenshots**: Captures individual PNG frames at configurable intervals
- **Adaptive Frame Rate**: Calculates actual frame rate based on capture duration
- **Optimized Output**: Provides FFmpeg command suggestions for video conversion
- **Flexible Duration**: Supports recordings from 5 seconds to 60 seconds maximum

### üé• Direct Video Recording (`capture_video.js`)
- **Real-Time Recording**: Records video directly without intermediate frame files
- **Screen Capture Integration**: Uses FFmpeg for live screen recording
- **Audio Support**: Includes audio recording capability (VB-Audio Virtual Cable)
- **Automatic Timing**: Starts and stops recording based on animation completion

### üõ†Ô∏è FFmpeg Integration (`ffmpeg_record.js`)
- **Screen Region Capture**: Records specific screen regions (480x916 pixels)
- **Audio/Video Sync**: Combines screen capture with audio input
- **High-Quality Encoding**: Uses H.264 codec with optimized settings
- **Background Processing**: Handles FFmpeg processes with proper cleanup

### üìä Smart Recording Features
- **Viewport Optimization**: Fixed 500x1100 viewport for consistent output
- **Console Logging**: Captures and displays browser console messages
- **Error Handling**: Robust error handling and process management
- **Timestamp Generation**: Automatic file naming with ISO timestamps

## üöÄ Installation and Setup

### Prerequisites
- **Node.js**: Version 14 or higher
- **FFmpeg**: Required for video recording functionality
- **VB-Audio Virtual Cable**: Optional, for audio recording

### Installation Steps

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/AleemAkhtar/web-to-video.git
   cd web-to-video
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Install FFmpeg**:
   - **Windows**: Download from [FFmpeg.org](https://ffmpeg.org/download.html) and add to PATH
   - **macOS**: `brew install ffmpeg`
   - **Linux**: `sudo apt install ffmpeg` or `sudo yum install ffmpeg`

4. **Optional - Install VB-Audio Virtual Cable** (for audio recording):
   - Download from [VB-Audio website](https://vb-audio.com/Cable/)

## üé¨ How to Run

### Method 1: Frame-by-Frame Capture
```bash
node capture_images.js
```
- Captures individual frames to the `frames/` directory
- Provides FFmpeg command for video conversion
- Best for high-quality output and custom post-processing

### Method 2: Direct Video Recording
```bash
node capture_video.js
```
- Records video directly to MP4 file
- Includes audio if VB-Audio Virtual Cable is configured
- Generates timestamped output files

### Prerequisites for Recording
- Ensure your web application is running on `http://127.0.0.1:3000`
- Your web page should set `window.animationFinished = true` when the animation is complete
- For audio recording, configure VB-Audio Virtual Cable as your system's audio output

### Example Workflow
1. Start your web application on port 3000
2. Run either recording script
3. The browser will automatically navigate to your page
4. Recording starts after a 2-second delay
5. Recording stops when `window.animationFinished` becomes `true`
6. Output video/frames are saved to the project directory

## üìÅ Output Files

- **Frame Capture**: PNG files in `frames/` directory (`frame_0001.png`, `frame_0002.png`, etc.)
- **Video Recording**: MP4 files with timestamp (`recording-2025-06-13T12-30-42-132Z.mp4`)
- **Logs**: Console output with capture statistics and FFmpeg commands

## üîß Configuration

### Viewport Settings
- **Width**: 500px
- **Height**: 1100px
- **Window Position**: Top-left corner (0,0)

### Recording Settings
- **Frame Rate**: Dynamic (calculated based on capture speed)
- **Video Quality**: H.264 codec, YUV420p pixel format
- **Audio**: AAC codec (when available)
- **Screen Region**: 480x916 pixels with 20px offset

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### Common Issues
- **FFmpeg not found**: Ensure FFmpeg is installed and added to your system PATH
- **Port 3000 not accessible**: Make sure your web application is running on the correct port
